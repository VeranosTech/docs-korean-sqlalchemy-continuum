"When changing entities and committing results into database Continuum "
"saves the used operations (INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE) into version "
"entities. The operation types are stored by default to a small integer "
"field named 'operation_type'. Class called 'Operation' holds convenient "
"constants for these values as shown below:"

"Continuum provides easy way for getting the changeset of given version "

"changed fields in that version."

"SQLAlchemy-Continuum also provides a utility function called changeset. "
"With this function you can easily check the changeset of given object in "

"Each version object reflects all parent object relationships. You can "

"Lets say you have two models: Article and Category. Each Article has one "
"Category. In the following example we first add article and category "
"objects into database."

#: ../../version_objects.rst:115
msgid ""
"Continuum saves new ArticleVersion and CategoryVersion records in the "
"background. After that we update the created article entity to use "
"another category. Continuum creates new version objects accordingly."

#: ../../version_objects.rst:117
msgid "Lastly we check the category relations of different article versions."

"Let's take previous example of Articles and Categories. Now consider that"
" only Article model is versioned:"

"Here Article versions will still reflect the relationships of Article "
"model but they will simply return Category objects instead of "
"CategoryVersion objects:"

"If the parent class has a dynamic relationship it will be reflected as a "
