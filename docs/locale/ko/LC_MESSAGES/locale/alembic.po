"Each time you make changes to database structure you should also change "
"the associated history tables. When you make changes to your models "
"SQLAlchemy-Continuum automatically alters the history model definitions, "
"hence you can use `alembic revision --autogenerate` just like before. You"
" just need to make sure `make_versioned` function gets called before "
"alembic gathers all your models."
